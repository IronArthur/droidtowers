This is the source code for Droid Towers, a game for Android.  It is a 
tower building simulation inspired by SimTower.  I have added my own game play
elements that I felt improved on the original game.

I am looking for someone to maybe take over the game.  It makes around $200 a month with zero
advertising.  I never really did much promotion beyond a reddit post.  I would love to see
someone take this over and make it much bigger.  If you're interested in this, email me phil@happydroids.com
so we can chat about the details.

The game is licensed under creative commons, see the LICENSE file for details.


I originally released this on July 10, 2012 as a sort of tribute to my Father whom shares the same birthday.
